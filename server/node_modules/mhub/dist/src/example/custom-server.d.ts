/**
 * Simple example of setting up your own MHub server instance
 * from scratch, to integrate it in your own application backend.
 *
 * The example sets up a websocket server for external users to
 * connect to, but also connects to the hub using an internal
 * connection (like you'd e.g. use for your API backend).
 *
 * See `../nodeserver.ts` for more inspiration.
